          Pele, whose full name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento, is a legendary
          Brazilian football player and one of the greatest footballers of all
          time. Born on October 23, 1940, in Tres Coracoes, Brazil, Pele began
          his professional career at the age of 16 with Santos FC. He gained
          global recognition for his exceptional skills, agility, and
          goal-scoring ability. Pele won three FIFA World Cups with the

          for his philanthropy work and advocacy for social issues, leaving an
          indelible mark on the world of football and beyond.
